# Claude Code Resume Context - WOPR Project

## Session Date: 2026-01-19

## Project Location
`/home/corey/source/repos/personal/WOPR`

## Current State
There are **uncommitted changes** that need to be committed and pushed.

### Files Modified (not yet committed):
1. `wopr/games/cards/poker.py` - Fixed showdown display (labels on separate lines)
2. `wopr/games/cards/gin_rummy.py` - Fixed DEADWOOD label display
3. `wopr/games/cards/bridge.py` - Fixed YOUR HAND label display
4. `README.md` - Added terminal settings recommendations (100x35 minimum)

### What These Fixes Address:
The UI scaling work (making cards into ASCII art boxes) broke displays where labels were inline with multi-line card rendering. Fixed by putting labels on separate lines before the card art.

## What Needs To Be Done

### 1. Commit and push the fixes:
```bash
cd /home/corey/source/repos/personal/WOPR
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix card game rendering and add terminal recommendations
